<h4 class="subsection">6.6.5 Updating Methods for indirect buffers</h4>

<p>ECB works out of the box with indirect buffers, especially with indirect
buffer clones created with the command <code>clone-indirect-buffer</code> (only
available with GNU Emacs &gt;= 21). They will be handled as all other buffers and
you can work with them with no difference to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; buffers. With one
exception:

   <p><strong>Please note</strong>: Cause of a bug in Emacs 22 (and maybe also in Emacs 23)
the propagation of parsing informations from one buffer to all others which are
in an indirect-buffer relation to the same base-buffer does currently not
work.

   <p>What does this mean: If you modify a buffer then Emacs propagates this change
to all buffers with the same base-buffer. ECB/semantic recognize this change
and do all necessary to automatically reparse the changed buffer (at least if
you have customized semantic/ECB to do this). So far so good, but: If you
switch to another buffer with the same base-buffer then you will notice that
the methods-window of ECB still displays the contents before the change, ie. 
the need for a reparse has not been propagated to these other buffers. This is
a bug in Emacs.

   <p>What can you do: As long as this bug is not fixed there is no chance that all
other affected &ldquo;indirect-related&rdquo; buffers will be reparsed automatically
after modifying one of them. So you have to do this reparse &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; after
switching to such an indirect-related buffer, but this is very simple: Just
call the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code> with prefix arg or hit
&lt;C-u C-c . r&gt; (key this command is bound to).

   <p>Lets make an example:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>
Suppose we have a sourcefile test.java loaded as a buffer into Emacs and
suppose further we have created two indirect-buffer clones test-clone1.java and
test-clone2.java - all of these buffers point to the same file: test.java.

     <li>
Now lets be the buffer test-clone1.java the current buffer and let us modify
it (e.g. adding a new method). If you have enabled the idle-reparse mechanism
of semantic (see <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>) then this buffer will be
reparsed automatically and ECBs methods-window will be updated in turn too.

     <li>
So far so good. But if you now switch to one of the two other buffers, lets
say to test.java, then you will notice that the change done in
test-clone1.java is also visible in the buffer test.java but the
ECB-methods-window for test.java will display the contents before the change. 
This is cause of the Emacs-bug described above.

     <li>
To update the methods-window for test.java to the new contents you have to call
<code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code> with prefix argument (ie. clear-cache is
true) or hitting &lt;C-u C-c . r&gt;. Note: Calling this command without prefix
argument is not enough!

        </ol>
